## Inspiration ##

The code present in the package is largely inspired from [Dr David C. Howell] (http://www.uvm.edu/~psych/?Page=faculty/Howell.php&SM=facultysubmenu.html "Dr David C. Howell") demonstration of [resampling statistics for paired observations](http://www.uvm.edu/~dhowell/methods8/Supplements/R-Programs/RandomizedRepeated.R "resampling statistics for paired observations") from his book:

> Howell, D.C. (2012) Statistical methods for psychology (8th edition) 
> Australia: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning.

It would be greatly appreciate to include his book as a reference in any publication that required the use of this package.
